> Do well, bad things will work themselves out.  
>> First of all, when creating this project, the team's goal was to learn how to create e-commerce-aplications. To create them correctly, as far as possible, given the team's experience. Also to learn how to use GitHub tools for teamwork.  

Team members:  
- [__Makaeva Elena__ ](https://github.com/MakaevaElena "Elena`s GitHub") Team leader. The most persistent and most beautiful team member. Are you looking for a thought leader? Or someone who can make you want to work by example? Look no further. She is exactly what you've been looking for.
- [__Siarhei Muliarenka__](https://github.com/surface74 "Siarhei`s GitHub")  The most experienced among us. If you have a need to create a development environment configuration, the best solution is to turn to him.  
- [__Vladimir Sobolev__](https://github.com/VladimirSobbolev "Vladimir`s GitHub") The most inquisitive member. Want plates, fruit or something a little more interesting on CSS? Just give him a hint.
