# eCommerce-Application
This project is developed by the team ___Up&Go___.  

## Up&Go team
The team was created as part of the program of phase 2 of the course [JSFE2023Q1](https://wearecommunity.io/events/js-fe-rs-2023q1)  
> __Do well, bad things will work themselves out.__  
>> First of all, when creating this project, the team's goal was to learn how to create e-commerce-aplications. To create them correctly, as far as possible, given the team's experience. Also to learn how to use GitHub tools for teamwork.
